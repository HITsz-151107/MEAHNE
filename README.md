# MEAHNE
mirna-disease potential association prediction
Heterogeneous Neural Network
Same type of node aggregation (semantic attention aggregation) + semantic information fusion
Multi-metapath semantic fusion
Two-class cross entropy
from hitsz Bioinformatics Laboratory

The data is placed in the DATA folder
The reproduction method is: execute the jupyter files in order

Advantages of our model: Propose a semantic-level attention mechanism on heterogeneous networks, 
instead of simply treating metapath edges as equivalent.
